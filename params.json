{"name":"RAHFT","tagline":"RAHFT: A tool for verifying Horn clauses using abstract interpretation and finite tree automata","body":"# Refinement of Abstraction in Horn clauses using Finite Tree automata (RAHFT)\r\nRAHFT is a  tool based on  abstraction refinement for verifying Constrained Horn clauses using abstract interpretation and finite tree automata. \r\n\r\n## Programming \r\nRAHFT is written in Ciao prolog (32 bit version) and is interfaced with Parma polyhedra libray for handling constraints. Any library interfaced with Ciao should also be in 32 bit. ConstraintSpecialisation uses several reusable components such as Convex polyhedra analyser, \r\nQuery-answer tranformer etc. tied together using a shell script. It also includes a Java library for manipulating finite tree automata.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n1. Ciao prolog\r\n2. Parma polyhedra libray\r\n\r\n## Input and output:\r\nInput: a set of Horn clauses together with integrity constraints. They are written using Prolog notation:\r\n\r\ne.g. a clause is written as: h(X):- C, b1(X1),...,bn(Xn). \r\n\r\nand an integrity constriant is written as false:- C, b1(X1),...,bn(Xn).\r\n\r\nOutput: safe or unsafe.\r\n\r\n## How to run:\r\n1. cd src\r\n2. ciaoc thresholds; ciaoc cpascc; ciaoc qa; ciaoc insertProps; ciaoc stripSuffix; ciaoc genfta; ciaoc cha; ciaoc checkSafety; ciaoc counterExample; ciaoc splitClauseIds; ciaoc ftaRefine\r\n3. sh rahft.sh \\<File containing a set of Horn clauses\\> \r\n\r\nPlease edit rahft.sh before running the program.\r\n\r\n## References:\r\n1.
